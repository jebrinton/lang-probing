# Language probing -> steering vector activation project

## Description

I'll put more information here later, but so far this has been a project in probing for grammatical concepts in Llama across languages. I'm currently working on learning steering vectors for grammatical concept values across languages and layers. Further work will investigate relations between them, causal verification, and the implications for how language models implement translation.
